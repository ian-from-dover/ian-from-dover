# Heyo 👋
My name is Ian and I'm studying Computer Science at NUS. I hope to work in UX in the future, and I care most about making products useful, learnable and enjoyable. When I'm not being a nerd, I enjoy playing the piano, learning Japanese and conversing with my friends. I don't watch anime though.

### I'm Currently 🤹
- Learning frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux) in TikTok's Youth Coding Camp
- Creating a VRChat World in Unity

### I Want To 🎯
- Redesign Plover, an app which allows anyone to type with stenography, to give it a more intuitive user experience
- Create an open-source library of XR interactions to compile interaction patterns across the growing discipline. Do let me know in an issue if you're willing to contribute! 
- Learn modelling in Blender and rendering in Unity or Unreal Engine to create amazing lighting for scenes 🏞
- Learn Three.js to create WebXR experiences

### Past Projects 🎒
